Enterprise Software Solutions üè¢ - Project Management System (PMS) and Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Project Overview üöÄ

As the client (a mid-sized manufacturing firm with 500+ employees across multiple sites), I'm excited to partner on building two critical enterprise applications to streamline our operations. These tools will replace outdated legacy systems, enabling scalable growth to handle 10,000+ users/transactions daily while ensuring 99.9% uptime, data security (GDPR/CCPA compliant), and mobile responsiveness.

### Product 1: Project Management System (PMS)
**Description**: A collaborative platform for managing projects, tasks, and teams in real-time. Inspired by tools like Jira and Asana, but customized for our enterprise needs‚Äîfocusing on cross-departmental workflows, resource allocation, and analytics. Built with Django for rapid development and robust backend handling, it will support integrations with email (e.g., Outlook), calendars (e.g., Google Workspace), and our IMS for inventory-linked projects (e.g., procurement tasks).

**Client Vision**: I want a system that empowers teams to track progress, assign responsibilities, and forecast delays without micromanagement. It should handle complex hierarchies (e.g., multi-phase projects) and provide AI-assisted insights (basic, like risk scoring) to prevent bottlenecks. Scalability is key: Start with 1,000 concurrent users, scale to 5,000+ via cloud (AWS/Heroku).

### Product 2: Inventory Management System (IMS)
**Description**: A high-performance system for tracking stock levels, orders, and supply chain logistics. Modeled after modern ERP modules (e.g., SAP Inventory), it emphasizes real-time updates, predictive reordering, and supplier portals. Built with Go for concurrency and low-latency processing, it will integrate with PMS for project-based inventory pulls and external APIs (e.g., shipping providers like FedEx).

**Client Vision**: Reliability is paramount‚Äîzero tolerance for stock discrepancies that could halt production. I need visibility into warehouse ops across sites, automated alerts for low stock, and reporting for audits. Handle 50,000+ SKUs and 10,000 daily transactions, with microservices architecture for future expansions like IoT sensor integrations.

Both systems should share a consistent UI/UX theme (modern, Material Design-inspired), support multi-tenancy (per department/site), and include role-based access control (RBAC). Budget for Phase 1: Prototypes in 15 days; full rollout in 3 months.

## Key Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements (Applies to Both)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling; handle spikes (e.g., end-of-quarter rushes) with auto-scaling.
- **Reliability**: Redundancy (e.g., DB replicas), backups (daily), and disaster recovery (RTO <4 hours).
- **Security**: OAuth2/JWT auth, encryption at rest/transit, audit logs, vulnerability scans.
- **Performance**: <200ms API response; offline support via PWA.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant; multi-language (EN/ES initially).
- **Integrations**: REST/gRPC APIs; webhooks for third-party sync.
- **Monitoring**: Built-in dashboards (e.g., Grafana); alerts via Slack/Email.
- **Deployment**: Docker/K8s; CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## User Types and Departments

The systems serve our organizational structure: Manufacturing (core ops), IT (support), Finance (oversight), HR (resource mgmt), and Sales (demand planning). User types are tiered by role.

| Department | User Types | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Manufacturing** | Warehouse Operator, Production Supervisor | Frontline users handling physical ops; need simple, mobile-first interfaces for quick actions. |
| **Procurement** | Buyer, Supplier Manager | Focus on vendor interactions; require approval workflows and contract tracking. |
| **Project Management** | Project Manager, Team Lead | Oversee timelines and resources; need advanced reporting and collaboration tools. |
| **Development/IT** | Developer, IT Admin | Build/customize; access to APIs, logs, and admin panels for maintenance. |
| **Finance** | Accountant, Auditor | Budget tracking and compliance; read-only reports with export (CSV/PDF). |
| **HR** | HR Coordinator | Resource allocation; integrate with employee directories for assignments. |
| **Sales** | Sales Rep, Demand Planner | Forecast needs; link to inventory for quote accuracy. |
| **Executive** | C-Level (CEO/CFO) | High-level dashboards; aggregated KPIs without granular access. |
